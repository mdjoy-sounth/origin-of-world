    <article>
      <p>Everything that exists in the world has its own laws and abilities.</p>
      <p>Humans have laws—such as we cannot survive without oxygen and food. The eyes also have laws—they capture what we see automatically.</p>
      <p>In the same way, these abilities exist in the world, so we do not have the right to deny these truths.</p>

      <h2>Why these abilities affect the brain</h2>
      <p>Why can the brain not stop hearing Sounth? Why can it not stop seeing Visual Mind Illusion? Why can it not prevent others from using Ovjarb on someone?</p>
      <p>Because every brain is connected to the world, and these abilities operate through the world. For this reason, we cannot stop another person from using these abilities.</p>

      <h2>Why do some people have a \"sixth sense\"?</h2>
      <p>When someone says they have a sixth sense, it may mean their brain has a stronger connection with the world. That stronger link can make these abilities more vivid or easier to access.</p>

      <h2>Who is God?</h2>
      <p>Does God exist, and why are there many religions?</p>
      <p>Religions were created by people who had a stronger connection with the world. These people understood that God is the world itself, and everything is connected to the world.</p>

      <h2>Do Hell and Heaven exist?</h2>
      <p>Hell exists to punish people who do wrong in the world. It is a law of the world.</p>
      <p>Does Heaven exist? I don’t know because God has not given me permission to know this.</p>

      <h2>Do ghosts exist?</h2>
      <p>Ghosts do not exist, but <strong>dark energy</strong> does. Dark energy is created from the dark thoughts of living beings, and this energy can harm other living things.</p>

      <h2>What happens in Hell?</h2>
      <p>In hell, a person’s bones are continuously broken. After the person dies or after twelve hours, the body returns to normal, and the suffering continues again. Because of this, the body never adapts to the pain, and fear becomes permanent in the person’s mind.</p>
      <p>I gave this idea to the world because I felt the world believed I deserved this chance.</p>

      <h2>Are all religions' hells the same?</h2>
      <p> It depends on the founders of each religion.</p>
      <p>This is why multiple religions exist in the world.</p>
